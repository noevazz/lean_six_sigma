# Lean

Lean is an approach to quality that focuses on **reducing waste**, waiting time and saving money.

Lean is commonly used to find value in the process or product and maximizing it. In other words, find waste and reduce it to increase the value.

## Lean Outcomes

Outcomes of Lean:

- Reduce waste.
- Streamlining the delivery of products and services.
- Ensuring people with the right skill are in the right roles.
- Finding what we need, what we do NOT need and what we need to reduce waste and realize the opportunities.

## Lean Approach

With Lean you need to think in terms of:

- **Purpose**: The end product.
- **Process**: That leads to the end product.
- **People**: The ones who create the end product.

Lean is not an end state, Lean it is expected to be part of the culture and to be maintained.

## Lean Principles

According to James P. Womack and Daniel T. Jones (1997), the 5 key principles of Lean are:

1. **Define value**: What the customer is willing to pay for.
2. **Map the value stream**: Map the whole workflow of the process/operation. This workflow must include all activities, value and non-value, ownership, and decisions/hand offs.
3. **Create a workflow**: Create a better, more streamlined workflow.
4. **Establish pull**: you must produce only when a customer demands it (this is called Pull), shifting from a "push" system that anticipates demand.
5. **Pursue perfection**: Seek for improvement after this effort is done, a.k.a continuous improvement.
